Telegram bot + visualization for spiritual scripture references by topic


As I read if I want to store a reference I quickly take an screenshot/copy/picture, and send it to the bot. The bot transcribes it and prompts me for where it is from and what topic it should be stored under. It then uploads it all to a DB. Bot can be used by anyone on telegram 

The web-app is simple and allows for anyone to look at all of these references, as well as filter by topic
